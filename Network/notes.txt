1:The physical layer is responsible for movements of
individual bits from one hop (node) to the next.

2:The data link layer is responsible for moving
frames from one hop (node) to the next.

3:The network layer is responsible for the
delivery of individual packets from

control and synchronization.

6:The presentation layer is responsible for translation,
compression, and encryption.

7:The application layer is responsible for
providing services to the user.

8:The physical addresses will change from hop to hop,
but the logical addresses usually remain the same.
